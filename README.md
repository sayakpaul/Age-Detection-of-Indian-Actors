# AV_Age_Detection
The repository contains my experiments for this Hackathon problem by Analytics Vidhya: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-age-detection/

So far my best submission (80.3) is based on the following approaches:
- ResNet architecture
- SGD with a higher LR
- Exponentially decaying it with an LR schedule
- Half precision trhoughout the training
